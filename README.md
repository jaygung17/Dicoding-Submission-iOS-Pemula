# Dicoding-Submission-iOS-Pemula
MyCV, the first project I worked on after learning Swift in 2020, using the Dicoding learning platform and the Digitalent Scholarship from KOMINFO.

Even though I lacked a foundation in programming and logic, I managed to create a few rudimentary apps using my knowledge of the fundamentals. After that, I vowed to work harder and demonstrate my advancement in my favorite programming language.
I spent my first year concentrating on storyboard with auto layout/constraints, but after that, I was able to enhance and demonstrate my progress.
